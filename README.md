# MOD-2-Chanellnge--Refactor-VBA
Refactoring VBA to determine Performace

1.	Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
To Refactor the given VBA Code and Measure Performance
2.	Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
3.	Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
1.	What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? The advantages are that it can be done with less coding for more efficiency. The dis-advantages are that it can become too complex.
2.	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script? In this instance the pro is the coding is more clearly legible, but the same dis advantage applies; its complex. 


Deliverable 1: 
•	The tickerIndex is set equal to zero before looping over the rows.

•	Arrays are created for tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices

•	The tickerIndex is used to access the stock ticker index for the tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices arrays

•	The script loops through stock data, reading and storing all of the following values from each row: tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices

•	There are comments to explain the purpose of the code
All comments are prefaced with a ‘ in green.
•	The outputs for the 2017 and 2018 stock analyses in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm workbook match the outputs from the AllStockAnalysis in the module 
•	Unable to determine
•	The pop-up messages showing the elapsed run time for the script are saved as VBA_Challenge_2017.png and VBA_Challenge_2018.png
